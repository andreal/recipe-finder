#Recipe Finder
#Languages: Javascript, JQuery, a little bit of Node, HTML, CSS

#Description: This app allows the user to search by ingredients, and returns 5 recipes. To search with multiple ingredients, separate ingredients with commas.

#Notes: The API may not return a recipe with all ingredients- it contains between one and all ingredients.

#To run: This is running on a very simple node app. If node is installed, calling `node server.js` will run the applet on localhost:8000. The port can be altered in `server.js`.
